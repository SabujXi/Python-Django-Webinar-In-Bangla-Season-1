# Python Django Webinar In Bangla: Season 1
I am doing a live webinar with live question answer on youtube through hangout. Channel address: [Md Sabuj Sarker on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/MdSabujSarker)


All the codes during the webinar will be pushed to this repository.


# On Request I will do this in English too.
I have started doing it in Bangla (my native language) because most of the people in my [Python community: The Pythonic](http://thepythonic.lozish.com) speaks Bangla. If I get more interested people who do not speak Bangla then I would also like to do this in English.
